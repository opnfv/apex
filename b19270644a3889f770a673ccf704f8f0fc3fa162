The downside to that is that you won\u0027t have the \"cases\" and the default value in the same place.",

      "message": "The problem is that \u0027project\u0027 in this case is not the same as the key in the urls dict. Maybe I should have made it called like \"repo\" as the arg. But the argument to the function will be something like \"openstack/tripleo-common\", \"openstack/networking-odl\". Other git repos like ODL dont have the \u0027opendaylight\u0027 name in the prefix/ but they do have it in the project name itself. So basically I have to look for the project substring int he repo.",
