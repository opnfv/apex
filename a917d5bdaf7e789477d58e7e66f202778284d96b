      "message": "I thought about doing that and changing --virtual-ram to --virtual-control-ram, but I second guessed myself because we may have support to deploy more than just those 2 defined roles (since OOO is composable/custom role now), we may want to deploy an ODL role as well for dev snapshots.  So I figured leaving a blanket arg, then an overriding more specific arg was the way to go.  Is that OK?",
