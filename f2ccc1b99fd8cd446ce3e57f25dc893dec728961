      "message": "Having it is the system would provide a level of traceability since this isn\u0027t just a package hosted on a YUM repo that can be identified by using system commands.\n\nOn the down side keeping the file would increase the size of the overall image.\n\nHave you considered generating a script, copying it to the image and then just running the script rather than this long virt-customize command?  The cache directory can be mounted and the script just needs to copy the files over from that directory.\n\nThese are just some thoughts and questions that I have while trying to understand the motivation behind some of the build process.",
