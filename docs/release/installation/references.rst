OpenDaylight

Upstream OpenDaylight provides `a number of packaging and deployment options <https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Deployment>`_ meant for consumption by downstream projects like OPNFV.

Currently, OPNFV Apex uses `OpenDaylight's Puppet module <https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/admin/projects/integration/packaging/puppet-opendaylight>`_, which in turn depends on `OpenDaylight's RPM <https://nexus.opendaylight.org/content/repositories/opendaylight-nitrogen-epel-7-x86_64-devel/>`_.
