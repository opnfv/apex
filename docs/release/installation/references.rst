OpenDaylight

Upstream OpenDaylight provides `a number of packaging and deployment options <https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Deployment>`_ meant for consumption by downstream projects like OPNFV.

Currently, OPNFV Apex uses `OpenDaylight's Puppet module <https://github.com/dfarrell07/puppet-opendaylight>`_, which in turn depends on `OpenDaylight's RPM <http://cbs.centos.org/repos/nfv7-opendaylight-4-release/>`_.
