Verifying the Setup
-------------------

Once the deployment has finished, the OPNFV deployment can be accessed via the
undercloud node. From the Jump Host ssh to the undercloud host and become the
stack user. Alternatively ssh keys have been setup such that the root user on
the Jump Host can ssh to undercloud directly as the stack user. For
convenience a utility script has been provided to look up the undercloud's ip
address and ssh to the undercloud all in one command. An optional user name can
be passed to indicate whether to connect as the stack or root user. The stack
user is default if a username is not specified.

| ``opnfv-util undercloud root``
| ``su - stack``

Once connected to undercloud as the stack user look for two keystone files that
can be used to interact with the undercloud and the overcloud. Source the
appropriate RC file to interact with the respective OpenStack deployment.

| ``source stackrc`` (undercloud)
| ``source overcloudrc`` (overcloud / OPNFV)

The contents of these files include the credentials for the administrative user
for undercloud and OPNFV respectively. At this point both undercloud and OPNFV
can be interacted with just as any OpenStack installation can be. Start by
listing the nodes in the undercloud that were used to deploy the overcloud.

| ``source stackrc``
| ``openstack server list``

The control and compute nodes will be listed in the output of this server list
command. The IP addresses that are listed are the control plane addresses that
were used to provision the nodes.  Use these IP addresses to connect to these
nodes. Initial authentication requires using the user heat-admin.

| ``ssh heat-admin@192.0.2.7``

To begin creating users, images, networks, servers, etc in OPNFV source the
overcloudrc file or retrieve the admin user's credentials from the overcloudrc
file and connect to the web Dashboard.


You are now able to follow the `OpenStack Verification`_ section.

OpenStack Verification
----------------------

Once connected to the OPNFV Dashboard make sure the OPNFV target system is
working correctly:

1.  In the left pane, click Compute -> Images, click Create Image.

2.  Insert a name "cirros", Insert an Image Location
    ``http://download.cirros-cloud.net/0.3.5/cirros-0.3.5-x86_64-disk.img``.

3.  Select format "QCOW2", select Public, then click Create Image.

4.  Now click Project -> Network -> Networks, click Create Network.

5.  Enter a name "internal", click Next.

6.  Enter a subnet name "internal_subnet", and enter Network Address
    ``172.16.1.0/24``, click Next.

7. Now go to Project -> Compute -> Instances, click Launch Instance.

8. Enter Instance Name "first_instance", select Instance Boot Source
   "Boot from image", and then select Image Name "cirros".

9. Click Launch, status will cycle though a couple states before becoming
   "Active".

10. Steps 7 though 9 can be repeated to launch more instances.

11. Once an instance becomes "Active" their IP addresses will display on the
    Instances page.

12. Click the name of an instance, then the "Console" tab and login as
    "cirros"/"cubswin:)"

13. To verify storage is working,
    click Project -> Compute -> Volumes, Create Volume

14. Give the volume a name and a size of 1 GB

15. Once the volume becomes "Available" click the dropdown arrow and attach it
    to an instance.

Congratulations you have successfully installed OPNFV!
