OPNFV CI pipeline via Apex.

Apex is based on RDO's Triple-O installation tool chain.

Carefully follow the installation-instructions which guide a user on how to
deploy OPNFV using Apex installer.

Summary
=======

Fraser release with the Apex deployment toolchain will establish an OPNFV
target system on a Pharos compliant lab infrastructure.  The current definition
of an OPNFV target system is OpenStack Pike combined with an SDN
controller, such as OpenDaylight.  The system is deployed with OpenStack High
Availability (HA) for most OpenStack services.  SDN controllers are deployed
on every controller unless deploying with one the HA FD.IO scenarios.  Ceph
storage is used as Cinder backend, and is the only supported storage for
Fraser.  Ceph is setup as 3 OSDs and 3 Monitors, one OSD+Mon per Controller
node in an HA setup.  Apex also supports non-HA deployments, which deploys a
single controller and n number of compute nodes.  Furthermore, Apex is
capable of deploying scenarios in a bare metal or virtual fashion.  Virtual
deployments use multiple VMs on the Jump Host and internal networking to
simulate the a bare metal deployment.

- Documentation is built by Jenkins
- .iso image is built by Jenkins
- .rpm packages are built by Jenkins
- Jenkins deploys a Fraser release with the Apex deployment toolchain
  bare metal, which includes 3 control+network nodes, and 2 compute nodes.
