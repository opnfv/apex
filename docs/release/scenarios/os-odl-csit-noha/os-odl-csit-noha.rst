============
Introduction
============

This scenario is used primarily to validate and deploy a minimum Newton
OpenStack + OpenDaylight deployment with only required OpenStack services.

Scenario components and composition
===================================

This scenario is composed of only required OpenStack services enabled by
default, including Nova, Neutron, Glance, and Keystone. OpenDaylight is also
enabled.  File storage is used as the backend to Glance.

The purpose of this file is to deploy a minimum OpenStack setup that will
still be able to exercise OpenDaylight.  The use case for this scenario is
to be able to test OpenDaylight quickly in an environment with low
CPU/Memory requirements.


Scenario usage overview
=======================

Simply deploy this scenario by using the os-odl_l3-csit-noha.yaml deploy
settings file.

   ODL routes local subnet traffic to GW
* `APEX-149 <https://jira.opnfv.org/browse/APEX-149>`_:
