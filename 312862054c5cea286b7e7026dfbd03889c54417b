      "message": "The services here do not mean that the service is enabled. It\u0027s a combination of the Role having the service (what you see in this file) as well as the service being enabled (via Tripleo env files). Some of these services are enabled by default in this file, that\u0027s why simply adding them turns them on. ODL is not one of those services. Having it listed here does not mean it is enabled (it requires the inclusion of another env file). I\u0027ll add Horizon as well to this list.",
