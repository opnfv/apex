      "message": "Can I suggest you approach this from an alternate perspective? Instead of creating two execution paths, change the things in this block to make sense when the USE-EXISTING flag is set to true. So if there\u0027s already an overcloud and the flag is set, delete the overcloud stack. If the key needs to be set, set it. I think this will result in much more easily maintained code, and it will also make it so we can consume the undercloud from tripleo-quickstart, which is likely to happen within the next month or so.",
