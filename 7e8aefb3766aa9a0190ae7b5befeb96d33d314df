I added a second one since I figured control and compute are likely to have different settings - isolcpus would be different for each role and possibly each set of hardware. This was just an initial version to test that it was working, then I was going to add the ability to have different compute nodes take different isolcpus values as needed. Too complicated for first cut?",
