      "message": "You mean only use a single image? I added a second one since I figured control and compute are likely to have different settings - isolcpus would be different for each role and possibly each set of hardware. This was just an initial version to test that it was working, then I was going to add the ability to have different compute nodes take different isolcpus values as needed. Too complicated for first cut?",

      "message": "Ah yeah I see your point.  I was thinking for OVS DPDK I need isolation on every node, because DPDK requires pinning.  Maybe for a first pass just do the entire overcloud image.  Are we going to be able to dynamically get the processor information via introspection for baremetal and alternatively scale it based on processors defined for VM deployments.  I think that is what we need.  Thoughts?",
