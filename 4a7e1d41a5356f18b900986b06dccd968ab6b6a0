      "message": "I meant to to do it.  After discussing some stuff with trown, I think introspection just hurts us at this point.  Since we tag nodes as control,compute we don\u0027t use any of the introspection information.  I found out that the introspection uses an entirely different dnsmasq process of booting the nodes, and is more prone to failure than booting the during deploy.  I think it will help our stability to remove it for now, and then maybe turn it back on in master if we decide to use the stats for intelligent control/compute selection as a feature for Apex.",
