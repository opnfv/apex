      "message": "this variable seems to indicate plural, but there can only be one value here right?  If there was more than one, woudlnt we need multiple entries in the array like [ \u003cint1\u003e:tenant-interface, \u003cint2\u003e:tenant-interface ]?  Do we need to handle that scenario, or are we good with assuming this variable is always 1 interface?",

      "message": "While in theory we could support multiple interfaces, this has not been implemented and I don\u0027t think we will support it any time soon. In that case, we would be using a bond interface name and need to add support on VPP side as well, which doesn\u0027t exist today. I think this should be fine now, as this is how we use this variable everywhere else too.",
