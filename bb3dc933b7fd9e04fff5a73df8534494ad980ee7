      "message": "For other range settings we use this format.  I think we maybe need to consider using a different yaml construct (now that we have real yaml parsing) to allocate ranges as a separate patch (maybe this was already done in master with the network settings re-work).  The one thing I do see here is that vlan_id_range could be very confusing with \u0027vlan\u0027 key.  \u0027vlan\u0027 only accepts a single value, so only that single vlan can actually be used with vlan_id_range - because overlay network vlan requires the underlay vlan to be present.  I suggest we remove this vlan_id_range key, and instead make \u0027vlan\u0027 a range, then automaticaly set the physnet range in THT variables according to the range in \u0027vlan\u0027.",
