# This configuration file defines Network Environment for a
# Baremetal Deployment of OPNFV. It contains default values
# for 4 following networks:
#
# - admin
# - private*
# - public
# - storage*
#
# *) optional networks
#
# Any values missing from this configuration file will be
# auto-detected by deployment script from the existing network
# configuration of the jumphost.
#
# Optional networks will be consolidated with the admin network
# if not explicitely configured.
#
# See short description of the networks in the comments below.
#

# DNS Servers for all nodes, comma delimited list
dns_servers: ["8.8.8.8", "8.8.4.4"]

# Domain name to use for undercloud/overcloud nodes
domain_name: 'opnfvapex.com'

# "admin" is the short name for Control Plane Network.
# During OPNFV deployment it is used for node provisioning so
# PXE boot should be enabled for the related interfaces on all
# the nodes in the OPNFV cluster. After the deployment this
# network is used as the OpenStack management network which
# carries e.g. communication between its internal components.
