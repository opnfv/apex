# This configuration file defines Network Environment for a
# Baremetal Deployment of OPNFV. It contains default values
# for 5 following networks:
#
# - admin
# - tenant*
# - external*
# - storage*
# - api*
# *) optional networks
#
# Optional networks will be consolidated with the admin network
# if not explicitly configured.
#
# See short description of the networks in the comments below.
#
# "admin" is the short name for Control Plane Network.
# This network should be IPv4 even it is an IPv6 deployment
# IPv6 does not have PXE boot support.
# During OPNFV deployment it is used for node provisioning which will require
# PXE booting as well as running a DHCP server on this network.  Be sure to
# disable any other DHCP/TFTP server on this network.
#
# "tenant" is the network used for tenant traffic.
#
# "external" is the network which should have internet or external
# connectivity.  External OpenStack networks will be configured to egress this
# network.  There can be multiple external networks, but only one assigned as
# "public" which OpenStack public API's will register.
#
# "storage" is the network for storage I/O.
#
# "api" is an optional network for splitting out OpenStack service API
# communication.  This should be used for IPv6 deployments.
